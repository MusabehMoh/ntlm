# NTLM Express Example

This project demonstrates a simple Express.js server that uses NTLM authentication to retrieve the authenticated Windows username and display it.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install express express-ntlm
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
